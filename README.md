### Ostrich x86_64 emulator
Just a toy project to check out C++20 by making a toy x86 emulator

### Ostrich?

It doesn't really qualify as an emu(lator), it's more of an ostrich. And I'm sticking my head in the sand a lot.

### What C++20 is there here?

- Modules
- using enum
- designated initializers
