## Warning

This project is in early development, and I'm currently using it to try out various ideas. There are half finished features, un-used code and weird ideas on master.

## Ostrich x86_64 emulator / debugger

Just a toy x86_64 emulator / debugger with time travelling and an assembly interpreter.

Note that this only builds on the latest MSVC.

I haven't implemented a lot of instructions yet, but what is here should work, the tests pass etc. The code should be fairly clean, modulo some TODOs.

### Ostrich?

It doesn't really qualify as an emu(lator), it's more of an ostrich. And I'm sticking my head in the sand a lot.
